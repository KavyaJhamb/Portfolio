# Personal Portfolio Website

This is the repository for my personal portfolio website, built to showcase my skills, projects, and experience as a Computer Science student at SRMIST. Below is an overview of how I created this portfolio from scratch.

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Process
I started with the design phase using **Figma**, where I outlined the basic layout and user flow for the website. The primary goal was to keep the interface simple, clean, and user-friendly while highlighting my skills, projects, and achievements.

### Tools Used:
- **Figma** â€“ For wireframes and mockups
- **FontAwesome** â€“ For adding simple, clean icons
- **Google Fonts** â€“ For typography styling

## ðŸ›  Development Process
The portfolio was developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. I avoided any complex frameworks to ensure the website loads quickly and remains lightweight.

### Steps Involved:
1. **HTML Structure**: I started by structuring the website using semantic HTML5 elements like `<header>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` to make the site accessible and SEO-friendly.
2. **CSS Styling**: I used CSS to style the entire site, ensuring it's responsive. Media queries were implemented to adjust the layout on various screen sizes, including mobile devices.
3. **JavaScript for Interactivity**: A minimal amount of JavaScript was added to handle smooth scrolling, and to dynamically update the year in the footer.
4. **Deployment**: I deployed the portfolio using **Netlify**, a platform for hosting static websites. It also allows for continuous deployment whenever I push updates to this repository.

### Key Features:
- **Responsive Design**: Works smoothly on all screen sizes.
- **Minimal JavaScript**: Ensures fast loading times.
- **Clean Typography & Icons**: Enhances readability and aesthetics.
